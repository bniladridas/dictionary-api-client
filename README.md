This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Dictionary API Client

This project is a Next.js application that integrates with the Oxford Dictionary API to retrieve dictionary entries for specified words.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bniladridas/dictionary-api-client
   cd dictionary-api-client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API credentials:
   ```
   ACCESS_KEY=your_oxford_api_key
   APP_ID=your_oxford_app_id
   ```

### Running the Application
- Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Integration

### Testing the API
To test the API, you can use the following endpoint:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/dictionary?word=example
```
Replace `example` with any word you want to look up.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while using the API, follow these steps:
1. **Check API Credentials**: Ensure that your `.env` file contains the correct `ACCESS_KEY` and `APP_ID`.
2. **Verify API Endpoint**: Make sure you are using the correct endpoint format. For example:
   ```
   https://od-api-sandbox.oxforddictionaries.com/api/v2/entries/en-us/{word}
   ```
3. **Test with Known Words**: If you receive a `404 Not Found` error, try testing with common words like `cat`, `dog`, or `apple`.
4. **Check for Sandbox Limitations**: The sandbox environment may not have all entries available. Refer to the Oxford Dictionary API documentation for more details.
5. **Log Errors**: Check the console logs for any error messages that can provide insight into the issue.

## Git Workflow

The following flowchart illustrates the basic Git workflow for pushing changes to a branch:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Is there a new feature?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Create a new branch];
    B -- No --> D[Continue on current branch];
    C --> E[Make changes];
    E --> F[Commit changes];
    F --> G{Is the feature complete?};
    G -- Yes --> H[Push changes to remote branch];
    H --> I[Create a Pull Request];
    G -- No --> E;
    D --> E;
    I --> J[Merge Pull Request];
    J --> K[Delete the feature branch];
    K --> L[End];
```

### Troubleshooting Git Push Issues üõ†Ô∏è
During the troubleshooting process, the following Git commands were used:
1. **Set the Remote Repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/bniladridas/dictionary-api-client.git
   ```
2. **Push Changes to the Remote**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Update Git Email Configuration** üí°:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your_github_username@users.noreply.github.com"
   ```
4. **Recommit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit --amend --reset-author
   ```
5. **Final Push**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

These steps ensured that the changes were successfully pushed to the GitHub repository. If you encounter any issues, refer to these commands for troubleshooting! üìã
